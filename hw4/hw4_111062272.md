| -------- | --------------- |
| Branch   | 0               |

### b

ans: Reg[29] & 10

## 3

### a

least time-consuming instruction: add, with 600ps

Whose longest datapath is: PC read -> I-Mem -> Register File -> mux -> ALU -> mux -> register setup

### b

The minimum clock period is equal to the execution time of most time-consuming instruction. 

Therefore, ans: ld, with 835ps

Whose longest datapath is: PC read -> I-Mem -> Register file -> mux -> ALU -> D-Mem -> mux -> register setup

## 4

notations:

$t_1$: time needed to execute an instruction under 4GHz.

$t_2$: time needed to execute an instruction under 2GHz.

$t_s$: time needed for 1 stage under 2GHz.

To achieve maximum speedup, assume that time needed for each stage is equally distributed, i.e, $t_2 = 5\cdot t_s$

$$
t_1 = \frac{4}{4\cdot 10^9} = 10^{-9}\, t_s = \frac{1}{2\cdot 10^9}
$$

<p>
Speedup = $\frac{1200\cdot t_1}{t_2 + (1200 - 1)t_s} \approx 1.993$

## 5

### a

| instruction       | dependencies |
| ----------------- | :----------: |
| ld x28, 4(x5)     |   x28, x5    |
| add x29, x6, x7   |    x6, x7    |
| sub x30, x28, x29 |   x28, x29   |
| sd x30, 0(x11)    |   x30, x11   |

More specifically, x28 is the dependency between `ld & sub`, x29 is the dependency between `add & sub`, and x30 is the dependency between `sub & sd`. 

### b

There are none.

Explanation: Since all RAW hazards can be resolved by forwarding, and the only load-use hazard (between instruction 1 & 3) is separated by 1 instruction; so it can also be resolved by forwarding.

### c

ans: 4NOPs

Explanation: Between instruction 2&3, 1 NOP is inserted to solve RAW hazard, and 1 is used to solve load-use hazard. Between instruction 3&4, 2 NOPs is inserted to solve RAW hazard.

## 7

### a

5 + 2 (NOP) instructions; 5 stages => 5 + (7 - 1) = 11

2 NOPs is added between `ld` and `add` to resolve structural hazards raised by conflict between `IF` stage of `add & sub` and `MEM` stage of `sd & ld`.

ans: This instruction sequence has an execution time of 11 stages. Furthermore, structural hazards can be resolved by adding 5 NOPs between each instruction such that every instruction won't overlap in pipeline phases, which resulted in meaning lost for pipelining.

### b

reordered instruction sequence:

```
beq x11, x12, Label
add x11, x6, x12
sub x11, x13, x12
sd x15, 0(x23)
ld x15, 0(x24)
```

Since `add & sub` won't need `MEM` stage, `IF` stage of `sd & ld` won't conflict with them.

=> Minimum number of cycles = 5 + (5 - 1) = 9

### c

if determined in `MEM` stage: [beq, NOP, NOP, NOP, sd, ld, add, sub]: 8

if determined in `ID` stage: [beq, NOP, sd, ld, add, sub]: 6

<p>
Speedup = $\frac{5 + (8-1)}{5 + (6-1)} = 1.2$
</p>

### d

notations:

$t_s$: time needed per stage

$s$: remain stage count

$S$: total execution time for all stages

<p>
$$
t_s = \max(210, 160, 220, 180, 100) = 220,\, t_s' = t_s = 220\\
s = 5 - 1 = 4,\, s' = s = 4\\
S = 210 + 160 + 220 + 180 + 100 = 870,\, S' = 210 + 160 + 220 + 100 = 690
$$
</p>

<p>
Speedup = $\frac{S + t_s\cdot s}{S' + t_s'\cdot s'} \approx 1.11465$
</p>

### e

<p>
$$
t_s = \max(210, 160, 220, 180, 100) = 220,\, t_s' = t_s + 25 = 245\\
s = 5 - 1 = 4,\, s' = s = 4\\
S = 210 + 160 + 220 + 180 + 100 = 870,\, S' = 210 + 160 + 245 + 100 = 715
$$
</p>

<p>
Speedup = $\frac{S + t_s\cdot s}{S' + t_s'\cdot s'} \approx 1.03245$
